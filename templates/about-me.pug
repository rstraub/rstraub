h2 🙋‍♂️ A Little Bit About Me
p My name is Roy Straub. I've been (happily) coding since 2010 and made it my profession in 2015.

p Since then I have worked as a Frontend and Backend Developer, and like being a polyglot. Most of my experience is in Kotlin, Java, Javascript, Typescript, but I also dabble in Scala and Python.

p I currently work for Xebia as a Software Developer.

h2 👨‍💻 Passion for Software Craftsmanship

p After a few years of developing software I got my hands on a copy of The Pragmatic Programmer, which was a pivotal moment in my career. It made me realise the importance of the how of software development, not necessary the what.
